        Future
  In the future, I  would like to be a engineer, cyber security engineer or business man. I have a lot of experience with business as I used to sell on eBay. I managed to buy my phone off my mother for £400 because I sold stuff on ebay and I bought my laptop with a bit of help from my parents. I would also like to move to somewhere like Saudi Arabia (with my whole family/close Khamkars) when I become successful. My aim  I would like to see this is the future so I can reflect on what I have achieved.
